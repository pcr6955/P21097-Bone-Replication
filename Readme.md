# P21097-Bone-Replication
--MSD Project at RIT--

3D models are a great reference tool for healthcare professionals, especially surgeons.
Med Dimensions has developed a workflow in which bone models are generated directly from medical imaging scans, then 3D printed. 
They are a near perfect replica of the real boneâ€™s shape, but lack tactile accuracy.
Test methods are needed to quantify tactile sensations to improve the clinical relevance of these 3D models by using more similar materials.



--Project Goal--

To produce a prototype with testing procedures that can accurately and repeatedly test 3D printed models to quantify their material properties, 
which will then be used to identify the best models to use for practice surgeries.
